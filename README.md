# Microprocessador-Mips

This project was developed for study purposes. It documents the step-by-step process of building a MIPS microprocessor.

Abstract: This project presents an analytical study of a MIPS-based architecture implemented using a RISC-V microprocessor with a pipelined design. The primary objective is to analyze the behavior, performance, and efficiency of pipelining in a RISC architecture by comparing instruction execution stages, hazard handling, and overall throughput. The study focuses on the fundamental pipeline stages—instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back—and examines how data, control, and structural hazards affect system performance. Techniques such as forwarding, stalling, and branch handling are also evaluated to improve pipeline efficiency. By leveraging the open and modular nature of the RISC-V instruction set architecture, this project provides insights into modern processor design principles and highlights the advantages of pipelined execution in achieving higher performance and better resource utilization.
